    <h2>Drew Atkins Princess Ida</h2>
    <h3> Act 3 - Scene </h3>
    <p>
        Arac, Guron & Scynthius.
We may remark, though nothing can
 	Dismay us,
That if you thwart this gentleman,
 	He'll slay us.
We don't fear death, of course – we're taught
 	To shame it;
But still upon the whole we thought
 	We'd name it.
Scynthius.
 	Yes!
Guron.
 	Yes!
Arac.
 	 	Yes!
All.
 	Better perhaps to name it.

Arac, Guron & Scynthius.
Our interests we would not press
 	With chatter,
Three hulking brothers more or less
 	Don't matter;
If you'd pooh-pooh this monarch's plan
 	Pooh-pooh it,
But when he says he'll hang a man,
 	He'll do it.
Scynthius.
 	Yes!
Guron.
 	Yes!
Arac.
 	 	Yes!
All.
 	Devil doubt he'll do it.

Princess.
Be reassured, nor fear his anger blind,
His menaces are idle as the wind.
He dares not kill you – vengeance lurks behind!

Arac, Guron & Scynthius.
We rather think he dares, but never, never mind!

Hildebrand.	Arac, Guron & Scynthius.
I rather think I dare, but never, never mind!	No! no! no! Never, never mind!
Enough of parley, as a special boon,	No! no! Never, never mind!
We give you till tomorrow afternoon;	 
 	No! no! Never, never mind!
Release Hilarion, then, and be his bride
Or you'll incur the guilt of fratricide!
